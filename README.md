## Problem ‚ö†Ô∏è

Our solution is to address PSA Code Sprint 2023's </br>
**Problem Theme 3: Nurturing our future-ready workforce**
> As organizations navigate through dynamic business environments, the role of Human Resources (HR) becomes paramount in ensuring that the workforce is equipped to adapt, grow, and excel in the face of change. We need to build a future-ready workforce by attracting and retaining an engaged workforce, providing learning and development opportunities, and cultivating a purpose-driven organizational culture.
>
> How can data and AI empower HR teams to effectively manage change and build a future-ready workforce?

We identified 3 main issues faced by HR teams with regards to the upskilling of employees:
1. **INACCESIBILITY**‚Äã of employees to enroll in physical upskilling courses due to time constraints
2. **UNCERTAINTY**‚Äã of what employees want or are suited for‚Äã
3. **IMPROFICIENCY**‚Äã in technology among some employees, resulting in challenges in identifying appropriate online courses

## Solution üß©

We propose a web platform for HR teams to:‚Äã
1. provide **CONVENIENCE**‚Äã to employees to upskill at their own pace and from the comfort of their own homes or workplaces‚Äã
2. tailor‚Äã **LEARNING PATHS**‚Äã for employees based on their individual skills and career goals‚Äã
3. make upskilling‚Äã **INCLUSIVE**‚Äã and simple for every employee, regardless of technological proficiency‚Äã
